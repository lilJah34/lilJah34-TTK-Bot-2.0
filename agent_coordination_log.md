## ðŸ”— Integration Points

### Critical Dependencies:
1. **Data Manager â†” All Handlers:** Backend must complete data structures before UI can implement interfaces
2. **Location Service â†” Notification System:** Infrastructure and Backend must coordinate on region-based notifications
3. **Cart System â†” Order Processing:** UI and Backend must align on cart-to-order workflow
4. **Admin Interface â†” Management Logic:** UI and Backend must coordinate on admin functionality

### Potential Conflicts:
- File modification conflicts (multiple agents editing same files)
- API interface mismatches between components
- Data structure inconsistencies

## ðŸ“‹ Next Coordination Tasks:
- [ ] Regular progress check-ins with all agents
- [ ] Identify integration conflicts early
- [ ] Coordinate file modification schedules
- [ ] Prepare integration testing framework
